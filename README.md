I'm currently focused on building expertise in Identity and Access Management (IAM). I’ve completed hands-on projects in vulnerability management, threat detection, and an RMF case study that helped me develop a strong foundation in security. Check out my work to see how I’m sharpening my skills and diving deep into IAM.
